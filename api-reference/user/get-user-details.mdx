# Get Detailed User Information

This endpoint retrieves more sensitive and detailed profile information for the user associated with the provided access token. Access to this endpoint is restricted and requires specific permissions beyond basic user authentication.

## Authorization Headers
<ParamField header="Authorization" type="string" required={true}>
  The Bearer token for authentication. Example: `Bearer {YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN}`
</ParamField>
<ParamField header="Accept" type="string" default="application/json">
  Specifies the desired response format.
</ParamField>

## Required Scope & Special Approval

-   **Scope**: `detail-user`
-   **Admin Approval**: Access to the `detail-user` scope (and thus this endpoint) requires **explicit administrative approval** for your client application. Requesting the `detail-user` scope during the OAuth flow is not sufficient on its own.

<Warning>
  **Administrative Approval Required:**
  Attempting to access this endpoint with an access token that includes the `detail-user` scope will still result in a `403 Forbidden` error if your application has not been granted administrative approval for this level of data access.
  Please refer to the [Scopes and Permissions documentation](../../core-concepts/scopes-and-permissions#detail-user-scope-approval-process) for details on the approval process.
</Warning>
