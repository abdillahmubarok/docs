# Error Resolution Framework

Encountering errors during OAuth 2.0 integration or API interaction is common. This guide provides a structured approach to troubleshooting and resolving issues with your Mubarokah ID integration.

## General Troubleshooting Flow

When an error occurs, follow this general diagnostic process:

    B -- HTTP 4xx Client Error (e.g., 400, 401, 403) --> C[Client-Side Issues Check];
    B -- HTTP 5xx Server Error (e.g., 500, 503) --> D[Server-Side Issues (Mubarokah ID or Yours)];
    B -- Network Error (e.g., timeout, DNS) --> E[Infrastructure/Connectivity Check];

## Common Issue Resolution Guide

This guide, adapted from the `TroubleshootingService` concept, provides potential causes and resolution steps for specific Mubarokah ID OAuth errors. Always refer to the [Error Codes Reference](../api-reference/error-codes) for standard definitions.

---

### Error: `invalid_client`
*(Typically from `/oauth/token` endpoint)*

-   **Severity:** High
-   **Possible Causes:**
    -   `client_id` provided does not exist or is incorrect.
    -   `client_secret` provided is incorrect (when authenticating client in request body).
    -   Client application has been revoked or disabled by Mubarokah ID administrators.
    -   Mismatch in client authentication method (e.g., sending credentials in body when Basic Auth is expected, or vice-versa).
-   **Resolution Steps:**
    1.  **Verify `client_id`:** Double-check the `client_id` in your application's configuration against the one provided by Mubarokah ID.
    2.  **Verify `client_secret`:** Ensure the `client_secret` is correct and securely stored. Do not log it.
    3.  **Check Client Status:** Contact Mubarokah ID support or check your developer dashboard (if available) to ensure your client application is active and not revoked.
    4.  **Verify Auth Method:** Confirm if Mubarokah ID expects client credentials in the request body or as an HTTP Basic Authentication header for the token endpoint. Adjust your request accordingly.
    5.  **Database Check (if self-hosting Mubarokah ID):** Ensure the client exists and is valid in the `oauth_clients` table (or equivalent).
-   **Prevention Tips:**
    -   Store credentials securely using environment variables or a secrets management system.
    -   Implement configuration validation in your application startup.
    -   Monitor client status if a developer dashboard is available.

### Error: `invalid_grant`
*(Typically from `/oauth/token` endpoint when using `authorization_code` or `refresh_token` grant types)*

-   **Severity:** Medium (often recoverable by user re-auth)
-   **Possible Causes (for `authorization_code`):**
    -   Authorization code (`code`) has expired (Mubarokah ID codes are typically short-lived, e.g., 10 minutes).
    -   Authorization code has already been used (they are single-use).
    -   Authorization code was issued to a different `client_id`.
    -   `redirect_uri` in the token request does not exactly match the `redirect_uri` used in the initial `/oauth/authorize` request.
    -   If using PKCE, the `code_verifier` does not match the `code_challenge` sent in the authorization request.
-   **Possible Causes (for `refresh_token`):**
    -   Refresh token is expired.
    -   Refresh token has been revoked (e.g., due to user password change, security event, or if a new refresh token was issued and the old one invalidated).
    -   Refresh token was issued to a different `client_id`.
-   **Resolution Steps:**
    1.  **Authorization Code:**
        -   Ensure your application exchanges the code for a token promptly after receiving it.
        -   Verify that the `redirect_uri` in the token request is identical to the one used to obtain the code.
        -   If using PKCE, ensure the correct `code_verifier` is being sent.
        -   If the code is likely expired or used, the user must re-initiate the OAuth authorization flow from the beginning.
    2.  **Refresh Token:**
        -   If a refresh token fails, it's generally an indication that the user needs to re-authenticate. Redirect the user to the start of the OAuth authorization flow.
        -   Ensure you are correctly storing and retrieving the latest valid refresh token if rotation is in effect.
-   **Prevention Tips:**
    -   Implement robust state management for the OAuth flow.
    -   Handle authorization codes immediately upon receipt.
    -   For refresh tokens, have a clear process to guide users to re-authenticate if refresh fails.
    -   Correctly implement PKCE if it's part of your flow.

### Error: `invalid_scope`
*(From `/oauth/authorize` or `/oauth/token` if scope validation occurs, or `/api/*` endpoints if token lacks required scope for a resource)*

-   **Severity:** Medium
-   **Possible Causes:**
    -   Requested scope string is malformed (e.g., not space-separated).
    -   One or more requested scopes do not exist or are not recognized by Mubarokah ID.
    -   Your client application is not authorized/registered to request certain scopes.
    -   For `/api/*` calls: The access token used does not contain the specific scope required by that API endpoint.
    -   The `detail-user` scope was requested, but your application has not received administrative approval for it.
-   **Resolution Steps:**
    1.  **Verify Scope Names:** Check the spelling and format of all requested scopes (e.g., `view-user`, `detail-user`).
    2.  **Check Client Permissions:** Ensure your application is permitted to request the scopes you're asking for. Consult Mubarokah ID documentation or your client registration details.
    3.  **`detail-user` Scope:** If requesting `detail-user`, confirm your application has completed the [admin approval process](../core-concepts/scopes-and-permissions#detail-user-scope-approval-process).
    4.  **API Calls:** Ensure the access token you are using for an API call was granted the necessary scopes during the user consent phase.
-   **Prevention Tips:**
    -   Only request scopes that your application genuinely needs (principle of least privilege).
    -   Validate scope configurations in your application.
    -   Clearly document the scopes your application requires and why.
    -   Plan for the `detail-user` approval process early if needed.

### Error: `access_denied`
*(Typically from `/oauth/authorize` redirect)*

-   **Severity:** Low (from a system perspective, as it's often user-driven)
-   **Possible Causes:**
    -   The user explicitly denied consent on the Mubarokah ID authorization/consent screen.
    -   The user's session with Mubarokah ID expired before they could complete the consent.
    -   Mubarokah ID policies or security measures prevented authorization for this user/client (e.g., blocked client, suspicious user activity).
-   **Resolution Steps:**
    1.  **Inform User:** Gracefully inform the user that access was denied and they cannot use the feature requiring Mubarokah ID integration.
    2.  **Retry Option:** Optionally, provide a way for the user to try the "Login with Mubarokah ID" process again.
    3.  **Check Client Status:** If this happens consistently for all users, verify your client application is not blocked or disabled by Mubarokah ID.
-   **Prevention Tips:**
    -   Provide a clear explanation to users on why you are requesting permissions (scopes) before redirecting them to Mubarokah ID.
    -   Ensure your application handles this denial gracefully without crashing or confusing the user.

### Error: `unapproved_scope` (API Error)
*(Typically from `/api/user/details` or other sensitive API endpoints)*

-   **Severity:** Medium
-   **Possible Causes:**
    -   Your application is attempting to use an access token with the `detail-user` scope (or another admin-restricted scope), but your `client_id` has not yet been administratively approved by Mubarokah ID for that level of access.
    -   The approval request was submitted but is still pending or was rejected.
-   **Resolution Steps:**
    1.  **Verify Approval Status:** Check your Mubarokah ID developer dashboard or contact support to confirm the approval status for the `detail-user` (or other relevant) scope for your application.
    2.  **Submit/Follow Up on Approval:** If not yet approved, follow the [approval process detailed in Scopes & Permissions](../core-concepts/scopes-and-permissions#detail-user-scope-approval-process).
    3.  **Alternative Scopes:** If immediate access to detailed info isn't critical, ensure your application can fall back gracefully to using only basic scopes like `view-user`.
-   **Prevention Tips:**
    -   Plan for the scope approval process well in advance if your application requires sensitive data.
    -   Prepare all necessary documentation for the approval request.
    -   Implement fallback mechanisms in your application if a high-privilege scope is not yet available.

### General API Errors (401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden from `/api/*`)

-   **`401 Unauthorized` (`token_expired` or `token_invalid`):**
    -   **Cause:** Access token is expired, malformed, or revoked.
    -   **Resolution:**
        1.  If you have a refresh token, attempt to use it to get a new access token.
        2.  If refresh fails or no refresh token is available, the user must re-authenticate via the full OAuth flow.
-   **`403 Forbidden` (`insufficient_scope`):**
    -   **Cause:** Access token is valid but does not contain the specific scope needed for the requested API resource.
    -   **Resolution:**
<<<<<<< HEAD
        1.  Verify the API endpoint's required scopes in the [API Reference](../api-reference/oauth/authorize).

        1.  Verify the API endpoint's required scopes in the [API Reference](../api-reference/oauth/authorize). <!-- Actual links to specific API pages would be better if they list scopes -->
>>>>>>> e53122889454db5cc7fb2301c5fe2f30682d1cd4
        2.  Ensure your application requested (and was granted) these scopes during the initial OAuth authorization.
        3.  If necessary, the user may need to re-authorize your application, potentially with a `prompt=consent` parameter if you need to ensure they are presented with the scope request again.

<Callout type="tip" title="Debugging Steps">
  1.  **Check Logs:** Your application's server-side logs are the first place to look for detailed error messages from your HTTP client or OAuth library when interacting with Mubarokah ID.
  2.  **Reproduce Consistently:** Try to find steps to reproduce the error reliably.
  3.  **Isolate the Issue:** Is it happening for all users or specific users? All requests or specific types of requests?
  4.  **Use a Tool like Postman/Insomnia:** For `/oauth/token` and API calls, manually craft requests using a tool like Postman to isolate issues with request formation or parameters, away from your application code.
  5.  **Check Mubarokah ID Documentation:** Refer to the official Mubarokah ID API documentation for specific error details if available.
  6.  **Contact Mubarokah ID Support:** If you suspect an issue on Mubarokah ID's side or cannot resolve a persistent problem, gather all relevant details (timestamp, `client_id`, error messages, request details if possible without logging tokens) and contact their support.
